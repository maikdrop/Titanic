1. Goals

The main goal of the project was to gain knowledge about Swift and iOS development. In order to learn more while practicing and improve my skills, I've tested different technologies e.g. several package managers. So, I used Cocoa Pods, Homebrew, and Swift Package Manager to implement third-party libraries.

There were three subgoals:

- Implementing the MVP pattern
- Readable code and clear project structure
- Adapting layout for different screen and text sizes

2. What's the Game About?

Users move a boat horizontally by their thumb to avoid collisions with icebergs, which are moving vertically from top to bottom. Any collision will increase the crash count, and slow down the boat. The game is over when the user reaches 5 crashes or the time is up. After the end of the game, the driven sea miles will be checked. If they are in the top ten, a highscore entry is provided. The game state can be controlled with the action button in the upper right corner.

3. Game Features
 
The following game features haven been implemented:

- Countdown timer
- Score counter
- Game control options
- Vertically movable ship
- Horizontally moving icebergs
- Highscore list
 
4. Technical Infos
 
The following list contains the most important technical informations about the app:

- Development Environment: Xcode
- Language: Swift
- Deployment Info: iOS 14.0, iPhone
- 3pp Libraries: SRCountdownTimer, SwiftLint, SnapshotTesting
* Dependency Manager: CocoaPods², Homebrew, SwiftPackageManager

²CocoaPods was used to implement SRCountdownTimer from Github during the first phase of development. Later it was replaced with a customized class of SRCountdownTimer.
