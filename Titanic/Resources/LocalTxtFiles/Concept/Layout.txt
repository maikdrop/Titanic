Different technologies were used to create layouts in Titanic. Except for the GameView and GameView Controller all other Views and ViewController were defind in interface builder and initialised through a Storyboard. Autolayout was used mostly. The layout of the GameView was challenging. On  one hand the scoring texts and the countdown should be related to the text size chosen in iPhone settings. On the other hand icebergs and ship size should only be related to the screensize, because according to the game logic it doesn`t make sense to have a relation between text and object size. So, Autolayout and geometry were mixed and created programiticlay. A second challenge was the SRCountdownTimer, which was imported from Github. Originally circle and time label were created without any constraints and the consideration of the content size. The result was that the font size didn`t change when the text size was changed by user. This was resolved by implementing contraints programitcly and setting the "adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory" property to true. Additionally to improve the layout dark mode was implemented.
