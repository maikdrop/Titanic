Different technologies were used to create layouts in Titanic: GameView and Game ViewController programmatically and all others in a storyboard via interface builder. Autolayout was mostly used. The layout of the GameView was challenging. On one hand the score and countdown label should be related to the text size chosen in iPhone settings. On the other hand icebergs and ship size should be related to the screen size, according to the game logic it doesn’t make sense to have a relation between text and object size. That means that always three icebergs fit side by side on iPhone 8 screen or wider. If the screen width grows, icebergs and ship will grow as well. In order to achieve the described behaviours the following three points were made:

- Autolayout and geometry were mixed
- constraints and object coordinates were defined programmatically in GameView
- iceberg image were created by myself, ship image was created and designed by myself

A second challenge was the SRCountdownTimer, which was imported from Github. Originally the circle and the time label were created without any constraints or any consideration of implementing the content size category. The result was that the font size didn’t change when the text size was changed by the user. This was resolved by implementing constraints and setting the „adjustsFontForContentSize Category" property of the time label to true. Additionally dark mode was implemented to improve the UI. The graphic below illustrates the implementation of dark mode and the content size category of the font.
 An extra layout feature is localization. Titanic supports english as default language and german as additional language.
